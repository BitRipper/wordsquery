Background
WordsQuery basic idea is to help user to study new words with any language. 
WordsQuery use Google translate API with application that user can type words 
in mother language and then try to get them correctly with studied language.

How it works
WordsQuery user interface offers user possibility to select mother language 
and studied language. Word in mother language must be found with Google 
translate dictionary. After that word is correct then user can type word in 
studied language and when that word is found from Google translate given 
list then it is assumed that word is correct.
